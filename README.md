# SVG-Logo-Generator

## Description

This weeks challenge was to make a command line logo as a free lancer developer that accepts user input when prompted for a text. The text includes up to 3 characters along with text color when prompted to use either a hexadecimal or color keyword. Inside the questions you will have your choice of either a Triangle, Square, or Circle. Once all the questions are answered than a prompt will appear to open the live server to see what the logo looks like.

My starter code was based off of a repo on github: elizabetholsavsky/SVG-logo-maker modified to my own specifications.
